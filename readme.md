## Boring Birds

> In a casual game that didn’t quite sweep the nation, there is a bucket
> that contains some number of yellow birds, red birds, and black birds.
> When it is a player’s turn, the player may either:
> (i) slingshot away one yellow bird from the bucket, and add up to 3 red
> birds into the bucket;
> (ii) slingshot away two red birds from the bucket, and add up to 7 black
> birds into the bucket; or,
> (iii) explode a single black bird in the bucket.
> These are the only legal moves. The last player that can make a legal move wins.
> Prove by induction that, if the bucket initially contains a finite number
> of birds at the start of the game, then the game will end after a finite
> number of moves.

The proof is hard, but the game is fun!
